So, in stead of reading about astrobiology, I decided to play around with my electric violin and Logic. I stumbled over Mozart's Dies Irae on Youtube and considered it to be a appropriate challenge.

I didn't learn it well enough to do it in one take, so it's split in 4 bar sections. And there is something about the audio and my finger-placement that isn't 100%, but at least the voices aren't completely out of synch, as they were when I was 12 and tried the same thing but with an acoustic violin.

But I'm interested in learning how to do this properly. Despite the quality of the result, it was very cool to record something this epic, with four voices, in such short time.
