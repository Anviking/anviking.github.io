title: Silly variation of femenist song or: What am I doing with my life.
---

While reading news a couple of days ago I stubled across a catchy femenism-song. It is now then night before monday, 01:40 with school tomorrow, and I just made this. Don't asky me why I've dug myself in to chords recently â€“ it's not like I have don't have anything to do.

Anyways, time to sleep, good night!
