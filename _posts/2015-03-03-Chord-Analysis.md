title: Chord Analysis of Germany's Darkest Song
---
If this blog is not a blog, then this is not a complete blog post. Keep that in mind when we look at the Phillip-Glass-fast-food chords of the less tastefully named song Dicke Titten Kartoffelsalat by Ikke Hüftgold.

As with many songs I heared it somewhere, fell foolishly for the chords, and had to investigate. Here is a link to the [Hooktheory analysis](http://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/ikke-huftgold/-dicke-titten-kartoffelsalat)).

### Verse
`B - F`

`I - V`

### Bridge

`g#m - E - B - D#`

`i/iv - VI/iv - III/iv - V/iv`

There is basically only one thing to note here. After an array of two-sized major chord-tuples(*) we arrive at the bridge – the `B` in `AABA`. To our great surprise we are greeted by a `vi`-chord (`g#m`). The key has changed to B's relative minor, and we get a `i-VI-III-V`-progression.

Which is the same lovable chords that [Phillip Glass](http://youtu.be/nNiOqa1nWgI?t=34s) uses to make anything sound awesome.
