	Just nine months ago I stumbled across "Lectures on Types in Haskell" by Simon Peyton Jones. It opened my eyes to a new world. A world where the strange kinds of questions I'd asked myself since I started programming 8 years ago had been asked. A world that was interested in taking a step out and think, instead of accepting the limitations of the current system and blindly shipping. Now I knew that I had to study computer science, and wanted to work on creating new programming languages.
